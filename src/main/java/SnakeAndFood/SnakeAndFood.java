/*
Low-Level Design: Snake & Food Game üêçüçè
The Snake & Food game is a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake moving on a grid, attempting to eat food items while avoiding collisions. The game is simple in concept but requires strategic movement to maximize the snake's growth without running into walls or itself.

Rules of the Game :
Setup :
‚Ä¢ The game is played on an N x N grid.

The snake starts at an initial position with a small length.

‚Ä¢ The player controls the movement of the snake using directional inputs (Up, Down, Left, Right).

Game Mechanics :
‚Ä¢ The snake moves one step at a time in the chosen direction.

‚Ä¢ When the snake eats a food item, it grows in length, and a new food item spawns at a random position on the grid.

‚Ä¢ The game continues until the snake collides with the wall or itself, at which point the game ends.

Game Over Conditions :
‚Ä¢ The game ends if the snake collides with the boundary of the grid.

‚Ä¢ The game also ends if the snake collides with itself (i.e., its own body).


Understanding:
- Snake and random position Food population
- Snake eats to increase size
- Game ends when snake collides borders of collide with itself
- The player controls the snake's movement direction.


To clarify, the key requirements are:
‚Ä¢ A game grid of specific width and height.
‚Ä¢ A single snake entity, controlled by the player.
‚Ä¢ Food objects that appear at predefined positions on the grid.
‚Ä¢ Movement mechanics, updating the game state with each move.
‚Ä¢ Collision detection for both walls and snake's body.
‚Ä¢ Scoring mechanism based on food consumption.
